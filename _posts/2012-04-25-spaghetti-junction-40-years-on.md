Got an email from ITV local news about a T-shirt design that I did for fun back in 2006 – it was part of a series I started on Birmingham Landmarks.  They are going to be doing a feature on the iconic interchange for its 40th anniversary which is coming up in May and the presenter may, or may not, wear the T shirt.

The T-shirt was a tongue-in-cheek celebration of a landmark that Birmingham is very well known for.  This view of Birmingham, that drivers see when they zoom past on the M6, is probably what gives the city a bad reputation as it seems really built up and industrial.  What most people fail to realise is that Birmingham is a very green city with wonderful parks and trees – which you get to see only if you approach from the south.

Little known fact/urban myth: there is a beach under Spaghetti Junction.

You can check out the T-shirts [here][1] and find out more about the interchange [here][2]
