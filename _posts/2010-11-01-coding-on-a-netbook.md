Whilst doing quite a few train journeys I was getting frustrated at the battery length of my macbook pro. Sure it’s a fast machine but put it under duress running vmware and windows 7 and it wouldn’t be long before I’d be hunting for a power outlet on the train to plug into – accompanied by the social duress of having to ask a stranger to plug in my cable over their lap as they were in the window seat.

So I thought: maybe I could code on the road using a netbook – certainly the promised battery life sounded good although i was worried about disk and processor speed and the max 2GB RAM running Visual Studio 2010. I could sell my macbook pro for a decent amount and put in a super fast SSD and still have money left over so I put the mac on ebay. After selling it successfully to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Leckie" target="_blank">John Leckie</a> – producer of The Bends and Stone Roses debut I bought a Toshiba NB300 and maxed out the RAM to a hefty 2GB and stuck in a fast OCZ Vertex SSD. The laptop started to run really nicely and battery life was great. I put on Windows 7 Ultimate and got rid of the crippled starter edition and installed VS2010.

The results: well although the screen is obviously very small I’ve been very happy with battery life and compilation of a solution with 10 projects in takes around 10 seconds rather than 1 second on my desktop – but still it’s totally workable. So if you are thinking of going this way I would totally recommend it.
