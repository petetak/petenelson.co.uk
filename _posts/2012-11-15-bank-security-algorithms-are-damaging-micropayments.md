It’s been getting to the stage where almost every month my Visa card gets blocked due to Jungle Disc taking a regular, yet variable, micropayment from my account – usually less than 10 dollars worth.

I have used Jungle Disc for a long time and I make that extra effort every month to get the transaction through but there will come a point where it’s just not worth the hassle.

The bank’s flagging algorithms have previously picked up a fraudulent transaction on my account – but this has accounted for about 1% of the times that my account has got blocked.  Customer Services have no control to add a Whitelist – presumably they could simply look for regular payments to a provider and assume that you probably do want that service to go through after you have paid for it for 3 months.

This flagging damages startups to the core – as they have absolutely no control over the process.  The only possible solution I can see outside of the banks is to create a middleman company who is willing to always agree to honour a payment to certain trusted providers that have originated from trusted customers.  This seems like a crazily complex solution.  Paypal’s reconciliation direct from your bank account kind of solves this (although most startups prefer not to use Paypal for recurring payments it seems) and solutions like GoCardless also bypass these issues (but are currently limited to UK only).
