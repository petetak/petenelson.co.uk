One of the unexpected results of launching the beta signup was the interest shown by users in France, Spain and Brazil. Google Analytics Real-time has been on my monitor non-stop since launching the site and sites such as <a href="http://abduzeedo.com/sites-week-187" target="_blank">abduzeedo.com</a>, <a href="http://wwwhatsnew.com/2012/01/11/worfu-encontrar-propuestas-de-trabajo-con-twitter/" target="_blank">wwwhatsnew.com</a> and <a href="http://www.psfk.com/2012/01/twitter-app-find-jobs.html" target="_blank">psfk.com</a> have driven a lot of non-english speakers to sign up. Our plan had been to launch with English only to start with as we wanted to ensure the best experience possible but we are keen to embrace the rest of the world as soon as we possibly can. 

With this in mind we today implemented basic support for Portuguese, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Dutch, Arabic, French, German, Swedish and more. These languages will by no means have the full processing that we are currently able to do with English but as time goes on we will try our best to improve results for these languages.

Please don’t flame us if it’s not perfect – this is work in progress! <a href="http://workfu.com" target="_blank">http://workfu.com</a>
