This morning we released the next version of [WorkFu][1] with new Smart Profile functionality where you can show your skills off to the world by linking into a number of networks.  We are extremely excited by the response we have had.

A small idea of Neil’s has come to fruition with the addition of a tasty and fun 404 page which mimics the terminal/command line.  I posted this on hacker news and it started to go viral.  At the highest point it got to number 4 on the ‘charts’ and is now sitting at number 8 which is not at all bad!  Inevitably this has driven crazy amounts of traffic to our site.  Luckily it has remained responsive – mainly by following Stack Overflow’s best practice guidelines for caching..

Thanks to everyone for caring!
