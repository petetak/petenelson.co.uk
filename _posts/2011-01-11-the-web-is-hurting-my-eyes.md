As a coder I now can’t do without black backgrounds on all my dev environments – white just fries my eyes and gives me headaches.

My question is: how do I make the web less white?  I’m on it so much of the day for work and much as white looks clear and clean it ends up giving me a headache.  Any suggestions of browser plugins or solutions would be welcome.
