I’ve always been a fan of real ale and one of the things I like about it is the low strength.   I love the flavour of beer but quite often I don’t want to get drunk whilst enjoying a tasty jar – so this has always worked well for me.

In olden times in Europe fermented drinks were drunk all day as a way of preventing nasties from giving you food poisoning – but the key to this was that they were extremely low strength – so that people could get work done.

Whilst visiting a supermarket this week I was delighted to notice a whole new ‘mid strength’ section that is in reaction to the government’s plans to tax per % of alcohol.  I bought a massive selection, some of them ok (not sure Guinness works at 2.8%) and some of them pretty nice like Tolly English Ale.

I’m hoping that this will bring more drinkers to real ale since it is a drink that works so well at this percentage.  Lager starts to get a bit watery this low, although I enjoy it anyway.  The only problem is after getting used to this some Munchner Weissbier does blow your head off!

Anyway [here’s an article from the Guardian][1] with some more info about the government legislation:

> Low-alcohol beers are now cheaper than their more alcoholic equivalents, thanks to a 50% cut in duty announced by the chancellor in the budget – which took effect last October – for those of 2.8% ABV and less.

Happy mid strength drinking!
