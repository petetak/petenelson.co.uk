Coders today have the possibility of living the Rock and Roll dream: earning money doing something they love, fighting corporates to maintain artistic freedom and selling their wares to a worldwide distribution network.  Whereas I was once chasing the dream of becoming a successful music producer my change to being a coder in 2000 was potentially the best move I could have made.

The comparisons are numerous between Rock and Roll and coding:

*   You’re likely to get into them because you are bad at sports and social interaction
*   You see them as a way to gain credibility through success
*   Plans are hatched and built upon in a garage or spare room with like-minded nerds
*   You think that new equipment will make you better
*   You soon realise that you need to limit your equipment and get the most out of what you have to get better
*   You release your work to the world and no-one listens
*   You get smarter about what the world wants and that presentation/back-story is key
*   You release your work to the world presented correctly and (hopefully) you start to gain momentum
*   Rich people start sniffing round you and a bidding war ensues (very hopefully)
*   You are desperate to sign a deal, but once you do you realise you have signed your rights and life away in a terrible contract and you won’t get out of your terrible apartment for years

Ok – so hopefully the last part won’t happen and perhaps you can utilise your own payment mechanism to get people to buy direct from you to truly maintain freedom and joy in your life.

Even if none of this happens being a coder will still give you a great working life – much like music:

*   You get to work with some of the nicest people in the world
*   You will get a modicum of respect from society as a whole
*   You don’t have to wear a suit and work in a cubicle
*   You get to practice what many still consider a dark-art that no-one else except fellow coders can figure out
*   The landscape is always changing in new and interesting ways
*   You get to be creative and push yourself

Much like the music industry: the top 5% intellectually, business-wise and luck-wise will be the big winners whilst the rest of us continue to do subsistence-level coding – but I’m not too bothered as I’m just happy to do a job that I love and earn money which would never have happened for me in music.
