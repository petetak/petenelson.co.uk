After a lot of work on Neil and Mike’s part the Mixture signup site is now live!

Mixture is a front-end web development tool with one-click push of a site to a live preview url.  It’s got a lot of great features which are outlined on the signup site animation – but my favourite are the in-line to-dos.  These allow you to write comments in your code that then get pulled out into a master list of what still needs to be done on the project.

Over the past month we’ve been hard at work building the mac and pc versions of the app which have a LOT of underlying differences, but from the front end should look and perform identically. That’s been something of a learning experience!
