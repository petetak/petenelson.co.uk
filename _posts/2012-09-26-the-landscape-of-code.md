I find it interesting that as a project gets created and built upon your mind starts to map it like a city. As you work with it more and more you learn all of its intricate little streets and shortcuts, you learn to get to exactly where you want to go very quickly.

Even the best planned out projects (or boilerplated/kit structured like rails) don’t look like an American city with a neat, ordered layout once they have been built into a fully working application.  This is because no matter how hard to try to confine a plan to certain rules and structuring code (and in fact anything man-made) will always grow organically with workarounds, preservation orders and economic constraints.

That’s what makes it special..
