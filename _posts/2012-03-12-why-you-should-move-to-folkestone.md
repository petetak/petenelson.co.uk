I’m kind of surprised that the knowledge of Folkestone as a commuter town is still so low – it’s 52 minutes from St Pancras International (the most European London station), you can buy a 3 bedroom terrace with a garden for less than 150k!  I don’t think there are any commutable places left with this kind of affordability, and most of them will take you longer to travel to.

Some of the highlights:

*   Sandy beaches – both touristy and wild (Sunny Sands and The Warren)
*   Amazing housing stock that is actually affordable
*   Great weather from March-November
*   A beautiful coastal park
*   The best/fastest/cleanest commuter train you have ever seen which actually offers seats
*   France in 35 minutes by car from Euro Tunnel – often with 22 pound deals
*   Olympic Park in under an hour

In terms of where to live – personally I like Cheriton the most as it’s slightly closer to London (station is Folkestone West), is very affordable, feels really safe (maybe too safe for some!), has a big Nepalese community (good shops and restaurants) and has a lovely park.  Sandgate and Hythe are more upmarket (and expensive) and Folkestone itself offers massive apartments in beautiful buildings (but often smaller or no outdoor space)

OK – so the commute will cost quite a bit more but this should be offset by your difference in mortgage payments – plus you will get a much nicer house for your money!
