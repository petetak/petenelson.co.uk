Really excited to be putting a best-of album onto Spotify and iTunes for Shanghai Noodle Factory, Robot and Audio Video Disco.  Although much of the material is from a long time ago it still sounds really good – it’s great to listen back with more objective ears and see that the work we did in Magic Garden and Depp International (UB40′s now demolished studio in Birmingham) from 1994 onwards has some great ideas, rhythms and harmonies!  Finally the tunes will get out into the world and get an airing beyond Birmingham toilet venues…

I left the band in 2000 but it continued triumphantly in various forms and this album will encompass all of that material so it will be under the moniker of Shanghai Robot Disco. There will be a one off gig too on the 4th Feb 2012 in Birmingham at Jen’s 40th birthday party – can’t wait!
