cause it’s all about the idea right? ……right?

Wrong.  I’ve seen so many great ideas ruined by developers simply throwing together a CRUD application with little or no thought to design, user experience or just plain good ideas that are going to make the users giggle with delight.

Rails and other frameworks have lifted the bar – it’s no longer good enough to throw some forms together and have people believe it’s a product.  Don’t get me wrong – I’m so glad they came along and opened up programming to more people but developing quality engineering takes experience, time, work and a great deal of thought.  It’s like learning to build a car: you need to know all kinds of disparate technologies really well and understand how they work together.  And to make a car look and feel right it has to be very well designed so that the driver feels great when they are using it.  It’s exactly the same with software.

Plus new tech is changing the landscape every day – we are living in exciting times. But they are also times of backing the wrong tech and wishing you hadn’t, building against a relational database, a non relational database, a graph database, rewriting the same code 10 times to ensure it’s the best it can be and hoping and praying it will grow to scale in the unprecedented way of the web.

I’ll say it again: good engineering and design takes experience, a deep knowledge of your tools and a lot of hard work.  At [WorkFu][1] we have battled long and hard to make it the best it can be within the constraints we find ourselves.  So far we have spent 6 hard months making a product that looks simple and easy but therein lies the paradox:

> **The simpler a good product appears, the more effort has gone into its development.**
