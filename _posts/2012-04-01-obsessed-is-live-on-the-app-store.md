One by-product of working on WorkFu is that I have become really obsessed with Google’s brilliant realtime analytics.  So much so that we decided that it would be worth building an iPhone app that could give access to that data on the move.

Building the app itself was pretty quick but getting it through the review process (the first we’ve done ourselves) took quite a while – but finally it’s live on the store!

I have some redemption codes available so if anyone would like the app for free please let me know via @obsessedapp and I’ll send you one!  Please tweet and tell your friends about the app too if they like Realtime Analytics!

The app website is <http://obsessedapp.tumblr.com>
