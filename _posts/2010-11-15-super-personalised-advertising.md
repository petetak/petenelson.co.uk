Had just been discussing Christmas presents and the Kindle whilst reading the paper. Turned over the last page of the section I was reading and was horrified to see this:

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85" title="Kindle Ad" src="http://www.petenelson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/76125_452226776174_675321174_5864430_7462957_n.jpg" alt="Kindle Ad" width="451" height="604" />][1]

My first thoughts were that this was some massively high tech print service where advertisers could personalise newspaper ads.  You see it on the web all the time and I’ve seen it done in mass paper mailouts – but on a newspaper?!  I could hardly imagine the paper shop at the end of our road working with an ad agency to get this done.

I was quite relieved to come to my senses and realise this was just a coincidence – googling the book revealed that the hidden letters uncovered were in fact my full name:
