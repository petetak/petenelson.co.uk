A fact of life for most coders is working on legacy web apps. These legacy systems and known and trusted by non-technical colleagues – even so far as them mentioning their belief in the stability of the code and congratulating the coders on this.

In one such conversation I even brought up the concept of the ‘facade of stability’ – asking if they realised what actually lay behind this application that they know and trust. To be honest they weren’t even that interested in knowing what spaghetti and glue held the whole thing together – they just cared that it worked and didn’t crash and served the users.  
So the question is: does it matter what lies beneath the surface if the app runs as it should, specifically:

*   Comments in the code saying:  //I don’t know what the hell this is doing
*   Messy code/big blocks commented out and left there

The answer is probably not as long as nothing changes in the app or the environment but if it does then the whole thing could come collapsing down on you.  So much of my thought processes are taken up with: but if we could only start again and do things right this time around.
