This was one of the best articles that we have had about [Mixture][1] so far – not only was it comprehensive and complimentary but I really felt that Matt Reich truly understood the app and what it was for.  It can be a difficult app to sum up sometimes so it was really satisfying for me to see a writer communicating it so well.

The only downside was the Blue Beanie Day hats that we put on the app to support Web Standards linking to <http://zeldman.com/bbd> were on the otherwise beautiful screenshots.

We are working on lots of exciting ideas for Mixture and can’t wait to share more of them…
