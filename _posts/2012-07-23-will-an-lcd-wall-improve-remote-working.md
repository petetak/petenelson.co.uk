I’ve remote worked on and off since around 2005 and to be honest not much has changed or improved in that time period.  I’m a web developer and the main tool of the trade is Skype – the main improvement of this has been screen-sharing which is an invaluable tool when working with (maximum – on a free account at least) one other developer. Bookkeeping has also become easier with great web app packages like [freeagent][1].  But there are no other tools out there that have arrived and improved my remote-working life.

This is not a complaint, rather a statement – I’m still pretty amazed that I can live in a quiet seaside town and hold down a career working for remote agencies and companies.  We even bootstrapped a <a href="https://workfu.com" target="_blank">start-up</a> with remote founders and this has worked really, really well but I still miss the magic that happens when you meet real humans in person.

I choose to not view my co-workers in a video call because currently I don’t think it adds anything to the working experience – but maybe my view of this will change when video technology shows you a 180 degree view and bandwidth catches up to allow large, high resolution transmission – ie: an LCD wall.

In ten years time when we can have this affordable LCD wall installed in our home office – I wonder if remote work will be comparable (in terms of creativity, communication and fun) to actually being with your co-workers in person?
