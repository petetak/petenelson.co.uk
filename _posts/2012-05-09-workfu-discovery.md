It’s been a busy couple of weeks at WorkFu as we get ready for the beta launch.  We are really excited to start welcoming opportunity posters on board as well as introducing a Talent Search available to anyone.  We are getting so many interesting users on board and we wanted to make it possible to discover some of these wonderful people – now you can, and it makes for some interesting viewing!

This comes as part of a beautifully redesigned dashboard which includes stats of jobs you have created and applied for, your Twitter friends who are already on WorkFu and other friends who you might like to invite.

Be clear though – the best is yet to come – in around 12 days the full site will be going live and you will get to see the rest of this stunning app as well as the many interested opportunities we will be launching with.

Go WorkFu!
