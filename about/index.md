I am web app developer based in Folkestone, Kent. I code stuff in c# (mainly mvc), php and java – usually on the server-side. But I do also do some front end jquery, processing.js and am currently testing out Android. I’ve been in the web industry since 2000 when I graduated from a Masters in Computer Science at Birmingham University.

At the moment I am doing plenty of great service work as well as being a co-founder of [WorkFu][1].  Am really excited about the interest we are getting to the signup.

My profile on workfu is <http://workfu.com/pete>

Until July 2010 I was a director of [TAK! Design][2] with [Neil Kinnish][3] and [Dom Murphy][4] which we broke apart to pursue new ventures.  I am still a director of [Merge Media Ltd][5] – a company that builds safety training software for high-risk industries.

I have toddler twins who make life a lot of fun!
